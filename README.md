## Directory Structure
The top level ```MobileClockIn``` directory contains the code. This is in large part due to how Xamarin structures projects. To access the Xamarin mobile application, go to the ```MobileClockIn``` directory, within the first directory by the same name. The path for this is ```united-mobile-timecard/MobileClockIn/MobileClockIn```. If you're opening this project in Xamarin studio, open the upper level ```MobileClockIn``` Directory.

To access the Java Server, go to this path ```united-mobile-timecard/MobileClockIn/SBoot```. This is a server written using the Spring Boot framework for testing the application.
